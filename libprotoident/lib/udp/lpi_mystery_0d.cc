         * the other responds with a 25 byte packet beginning with 0x0a. The
         * next three bytes of the response appear to be some sort of flow id
         * that is repeated in all subsequent packets > 1 byte.
         *
         * Other codes used during the exchange are 0x0b, 0x15 and 0x1e.
         *
         * However, there appears to be no info on the Internet about what this
         * protocol is. Random ports are always used for both ends, so no help
         * there.
